# SnailPass
SnailPass is a simple client-server password manager, that i'm writing with my colleagues to make for ourselves a convenient, custom environment for storing passwords.
Now is proposed to make applications for three platforms. The client for each of the platforms is located in different repositories:
- Windows (you are here now)
- Android (repository is still hiden)
- IOS (repository is still hiden)
<!-- -->
The application also has a [server part](https://github.com/rebmanop/SnailPass-REST-API), where user data will be stored, validated and processed.
